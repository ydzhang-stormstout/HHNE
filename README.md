# HHNE

Source code for AAAI-2019 paper "Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding"

The HHNE code is built upon Mikolov et al.'s word2vec.c from https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/

## Compile

1. cmd "make" in folder HHNE/code/
2. run "hhne" in folder HHNE/code/

## Usage

./hhne [options] 

The Options follow Mikolov et al.'s word2vec
Options for training:

	-train <file>
		Use text data from <file> to train the model
	-output <file>
		Use <file> to save the resulting word vectors / word clusters
	-size <int>
		Set size of word vectors; default is 100
	-window <int>
		Set max skip length between words; default is 5
	-sample <float>
		Set threshold for occurrence of words. Those that appear with higher frequency in the training data
		will be randomly down-sampled; default is 1e-3, useful range is (0, 1e-5)
	-negative <int>
		Number of negative examples; default is 5, common values are 3 - 10 (0 = not used)
	-threads <int>
		Use <int> threads (default 12)
	-iter <int>
		Run more training iterations (default 5)
	-min-count <int>
		This will discard words that appear less than <int> times; default is 5
	-alpha <float>
		Set the starting learning rate; default is 0.025 for skip-gram
	-debug <int>
		Set the debug mode (default = 2 = more info during training)
	-save-vocab <file>
		The vocabulary will be saved to <file>
	-read-vocab <file>
		The vocabulary will be read from <file>, not constructed from the training data

Examples:

./hhne -train random_walks.txt -output hhne.embeddings -size 2 -window 5 -negative 10 -threads 32 -iter 5 -alpha 0.025

Input:

The walks generated by meta-path guided random walks, each of which consists of different types of nodes.

Output:

The file for each node in text format		(e.g., hhne.embeddings.txt)
